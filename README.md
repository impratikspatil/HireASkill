# HireASkill

### Problem Statement:
Everyone knows platforms like linkedIn, Intershala, Hirect, Naukri.com. All these platform are very good and there are so many other plaforms also available same as like these. But I haven't found any platform which provide jobs, work opportunites for unprofessional, those who don't have any degree and certification. There are so many type of works are there like work as a maid, waiter, gardener, normal person for single day work, so work can be of any kind but we don't get people for that work easily. We need to make so many contacts to find such people. So looking at this scenario we got a motivation to devlope an app which provide platform for everyone.

### Proposed Solution:
HireASkill provide platform for both professionals and unprofessionals or you can say those people having no any degree of excellence but want to work (work can be either small work or any king of work related to professional job or unprofessional), by using our app one can easily get job near by his/her location and he/she can earn money easily. We are mainly focusing on local buisness and local labours who doesn't get any platform to find job, these people find difficult to get work from customer sometimes due to lack of contacts and connections such small buisnesses get into trouble to find customer so we came with this app <b> HireASkill</b> which provide platform for both promiting buisness and finding job/work.
